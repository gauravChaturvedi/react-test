# react-test


Build a SPA in React
that:

- Pulls data of all [launches](https://docs.spacexdata.com/?version=latest#5fc4c846-c373-43df-a10a-e9faf80a8b0a) - filter out all launches before 2014

- The page should display "Total Launches"

- The list of launches should show in a list -- a list item should show the name of the capsule and the date of launch

- Leverage [this api](https://docs.spacexdata.com/?version=latest#cfcc49e7-5fe4-4dd3-9701-7c5caf7af9fb) to build out the following feature: If I tap on a list item from the list of launches, the list item should expand and show the following details: `flight_number, mission_name, mission_id`


###### Other Instructions 
While you're not expected to build an SPA that resembles a high-fidelity design, please make sure it is functional and also has appropriate UI elements in place. Don't worry about colors etc too much as it is code quality and various choices you make in the process that matter most.

Please work independently, make regular commits, spill coffee on your keyboards and be honest in your efforts.

Code this out as you would for a startup that you're investing in, yourself :)
